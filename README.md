# Inheritance
**What it is: ** One class (child) can use the properties and methods of another class (parent)
## Real-life example:
A **car** is a type of **Vehicle**. All cars are vehicles, so they inherit the general properties of a variable(like wheels, engine)


# Encapsulation

**What it is: ** Keeping internal details of an object hidden from the outside. You use methods to interact with data, not direct access.

## Real-life example:
You use a **remote control** to turn the TV on or off. You don't mess with the TV's internal circuits.

# Abstraction

**What it is:** Hiding complex details and showing only the essential features.

## Real-life example:
When you **drive a car**, you just use the steering wheel and pedals. You don't need to know how the engine works.

# Polymorphism

**What it is:** Different classes can have the same method name, but with different behavior.

## Real-life example:
The word **draw** can mean drawing money from an ATM or drawing a picture. Same word, different meanings.
